# IMDB Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis - AutoAI Pipeline v2.0.3

This repository contains a machine learning model designed for sentiment analysis of IMDB movie reviews. The model was generated using IBM Watson's AutoAI, and the accompanying Jupyter notebook includes all the necessary steps to retrieve data, train the model, and evaluate its performance. The IMDB movie reviews dataset is also provided in this repository for easy replication and experimentation.

## Overview

This notebook is optimized for sentiment analysis of IMDB movie reviews. It classifies reviews as either positive or negative using a pipeline generated by Watson AutoAI. If you plan to use this pipeline with a different dataset, retraining the model in Watson Studio is recommended to ensure optimal performance.

## Notebook Contents

This notebook is divided into several key sections:

1. **Setup**
   - Installation of required packages.
   - Connection to Watson Machine Learning service.
   - Metadata for the AutoAI experiment.

2. **Pipeline Inspection**
   - Loading and splitting the dataset.
   - Scikit-learn pipeline creation.
   - Training and evaluation of the pipeline.

3. **Model Storage and Deployment**
   - Storing the trained model.
   - Instructions for creating an online deployment.

4. **Summary and Next Steps**
   - Recap of the steps taken.
   - Guidance on further actions.

## Dataset

The IMDB movie reviews dataset used to train this model is included in the repository. This dataset contains labeled movie reviews, categorized as either positive or negative sentiments. You can use this dataset directly with the provided notebook to replicate the results or further refine the model.

## Requirements

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
!pip install ibm-watsonx-ai==1.0.* | tail -n 1
!pip install autoai-libs~=2.0 | tail -n 1
!pip install scikit-learn==1.3.* | tail -n 1
!pip install -U lale~=0.8.0 | tail -n 1
!pip install lightgbm==4.2.* | tail -n 1
```

Python version: **3.11**  
Scikit-learn version: **1.3**

## How to Use

1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Install the necessary Python packages as listed above.
   - Replace placeholder values in the notebook (e.g., API key, space ID) with your credentials.

2. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Use the included IMDB movie reviews dataset or load your own data.
   - Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to load your data, create the pipeline, and train the model.
   - The notebook uses pre-configured data processing and modeling steps tailored to sentiment analysis.

3. **Store and Deploy:**
   - The notebook provides code snippets for storing the trained model and deploying it as a web service in IBM Watson Machine Learning.

## Important Notes

- **Pipeline Optimization:** The provided pipeline is specifically optimized for the IMDB movie reviews dataset. Using different datasets without retraining may result in suboptimal performance.
- **Data Handling:** Be cautious when handling data connections, especially if authorization credentials are included.
- **Modifications:** Modifying the notebook may affect its functionality. The pipeline converts dataframes to numpy arrays before fitting the model, which is a current limitation.
